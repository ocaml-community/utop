synopsis: "Universal toplevel for OCaml"
description: """
utop is an improved toplevel (i.e., Read-Eval-Print Loop or REPL) for
OCaml.  It can run in a terminal or in Emacs. It supports line
edition, history, real-time and context sensitive completion, colors,
and more.  It integrates with the Tuareg mode in Emacs.
